                This one was sick. Blood Sugar delivers on the funky jams while finally getting in touch with Kiedis's sensitive side on tracks like I Could Have Lied and Under the Bridge. Literally the only thing I would change about would be to switch the track positions of Power of Equality and Suck My Kiss (really open it up with a punch and save the political jam for a little bit deeper), but other than that nitpick it's pretty close to perfection. Also, Under the Bridge was written about Frusciante, fuck you if you disagree with me.
