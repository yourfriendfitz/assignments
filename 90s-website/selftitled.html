                I guess every band has to start somewhere. Back in the days when punk rock was in its prime, all these guys did was jam the bar scene, and Kiedis's circulatory system still had most of its structural integrity, somebody got the idea that the Red Hots should put some of their songs down in vinyl form. The album itself is an atrocity - apparently the producer didn't get their vibe at all and was trying to force them into being some controlled rock group as opposed to the chaotic trainwreck of energy that early-80s RHCP embodied, and because of this, their debut album sounds like someone was holding them back with a leash. If you have the ability to listen to the demo version of Out in LA and Get Up and Jump (shoutout Spotify Premium), I suggest you do that first before those songs are ruined for you forever. Green Haven is also fairly good considering Kiedis wrote it about whales while he was high on crack.
